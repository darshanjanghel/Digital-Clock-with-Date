# Digital-Clock-with-Date
This Python script creates a simple digital clock application using the Tkinter library. It displays the current time in the format HH:MM:SS AM/PM and the date. The time is updated every second using recursion within the time() function. The display features a bold, large font on a yellow background with black text.
